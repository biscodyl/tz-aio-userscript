# Torrentz All-in-one Userscript

## Does everything you wish Torrentz could do!

This userscript enhances Torrentz (on all its domains) to include a bunch of new features. Among them are customizable magnet-links, ajaxed sorting, intelligent stats, and much much more...

_This project is mainly maintained on [github](https://github.com/elundmark/tz-aio-userscript/), so please report any issues or feature requests @ [github.com/elundmark/tz-aio-userscript/issues](https://github.com/elundmark/tz-aio-userscript/issues)._

## How to use

1. Install [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) or [Scriptish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/scriptish/)**(*)** for Firefox, [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) for Google Chrome / Chromium, or [Violent Monkey](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/violent-monkey/) for Opera.
2. Install the userscript itself from any of the following repositories:
	* **[openuserjs.org](https://openuserjs.org/?q=torrentz)**
	* **[greasyfork.org](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/search?q=torrentz)**
	* **[monkeyguts.com](https://monkeyguts.com/code.php?id=194)** _supplies secure updates_
3. Disable _Require Secure Updates_ in your userscript engine to enable updates, if not installed through [monkeyguts.com](https://monkeyguts.com/code.php?id=194). However, doing this is less secure, so be careful.

**(*)** Make sure you use version `0.1.12` or higher. Download the latest version [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/scriptish/versions/).

_Tested on Firefox 32+ (GreaseMonkey/Scriptish) Google Chrome 37+ with Tampermonkey, and Opera 12+ with Violent Monkey. It does not work with Chrome's built-in userscript installer._

## [Changelog](https://github.com/elundmark/tz-aio-userscript/blob/master/Changelog.md)

## Features

* **Default trackerlist**  _Customizable_ - Magically sorted trackers, that apply to all magnet-links.
* **Custom Search Engines**  _Customizable_ - Appears automatically underneith the search-box, and any selected text in the title of individual torrents. For added security the referrer is removed using `data:text/html...` links.
* **Custom CSS Editor** _Customizable_ - Added by demand, edit away!
* **Force HTTPS**  _Customizable_ - Off by default, but forces SSL (`https://`) if enabled.
* **TV Episode Links**  Helps you search for next/prev episode/season, click the links in the filter-bar or use `SHIFT+[arrowkeys]` when available by searching for the common patters _sNNeNN_ or _2013 01 01_.
* **Ad removal**  _Customizable_ - Wouldn't be a UserScript without this. Also gets rid of the "click popup ads". As new ads are added, this script will be updated.
* **Direct .torrent links**  Applies to all avaliable sites listed on each 'single page'.
* **Stats-bar**  Get all the important info right away, like seed-ratio, a Copy trackerlist button, a Magnet-link, links to the comments and the files, and the total amout of peers.
* **Copy Trackers Button**  Copies all trackers to your clipboard (if your engine doesn't support `GM_setClipboard` it shows them instead).
* **Ajaxed sorting**  _Customizable_ - Applies to all search results, uses `history.pushState`.
* **Exclude filter**  _Customizable_ - Remove unwanted torrens by keywords or `RegExp`.
* **Colorful results**  _Customizable_ - Uses a pretty solid `RegExp` pattern to figure out what is what and adds a background color, making it easier to scan every page.
	* Colors can be changed w/ the built in Color Picker.
	* All torrents in all search-results have their own magnet-link that includes your custom trackers.
	* Old/dead-ish torrents are dimmed out to indicate a "dead-ish" torrent.
	* If you use the exclude-filter, the number of excluded torrents are noted at the bottom of the list.
* **Comment links**  _Customizable_ - Changes all valid un-anchored links inside comments to links.
* **Exporter + Importer** - Saves your settings and so you can restore them more easily.
* **Smart keyboard shortcuts**
	* `C` - Copy all the trackers
	* `D` - Trigger the Magnet-link
	* `SHIFT + D` - Download a randomly selected torrent-file of those listed
	* `← →` - Navigate search results pages (Left arrow Right arrow)
	* `SHIFT + →` - Next episode/season
	* `SHIFT + ←` - Previous episode/season
	* `ESC` - General exit/close

_All these settings are accessed by clicking 'TzAio' at the top of each page, and can be flushed and reset if you want to start over, or take advantage of (any) new default trackers that might have been added._

**Remember to hit `Save` when you change your settings!**

### More features worth mentioning

* `.wmv` file warning.
* Adds an rss feed link for empty search results.
* Passes AdBlocker default blacklist.
* Works with Autopager (thx [roshambo](https://userscripts.org/users/143015) for the fix).
* As of **v2.4.0** no longer needs `unsafeWindow`.
* All the data you save is stored permanently and applies across all domains, without the use of cookies or `localStorage`.

## Applies to these sites

* [http(s)://torrentz.eu/*](https://torrentz.eu/)
* [http(s)://torrentz.ph/*](https://torrentz.ph/)
* [http(s)://torrentz.li/*](https://torrentz.li/)
* [http(s)://torrentz.com/*](https://torrentz.com/)
* [http(s)://torrentz.me/*](https://torrentz.me/)
* [http(s)://torrentz.in/*](https://torrentz.in/)
* [http(s)://torrentz.hk/*](https://torrentz.hk/)
* [http(s)://torrentz.ch/*](https://torrentz.ch/)
* [http(s)://torrents.de/*](https://torrents.de/)
* [http(s)://tz.ai/*](https://tz.ai/)
* [http://torrentz-proxy.com/*](http://torrentz-proxy.com/)

__Note that not all of these work, some redirect to _torrentz.eu_ and some to _torrentz-proxy.com_, but it doesn't hur to have them all apply anyways.__

## Known Issues

* Some have had it stop working this summer, due to (**I think**) the fact that GreaseMonkey has changed it's ways. Follow the instructions **[here](https://github.com/elundmark/tz-aio-userscript/issues/5)** (Issue[#5](https://github.com/elundmark/tz-aio-userscript/issues/5)) and you should be able to spring it back to life. Please leave a comment if you had any luck - **and keep an eye on that page if you didn't have any luck, a better and final solution should be up pretty soon**.

## Using a proxy?

If you can't use **torrentz-proxy.com**, you can try installing [this special version](https://github.com/elundmark/tz-aio-userscript/raw/master/tz-aio.proxy-fix.user.js), which runs on _every_ page, thus making it work again. But It's not *100%* guarateed, it depends on the proxy provider, and seeing there's like 100.000.000 of them I'm not gonna even try.
